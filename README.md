Bron's Advanced Cryptography Library

This library provides implementations of state-of-the-art cryptographic protocols, written by cryptographers for cryptographers, using modern software engineering practices. Our approach is characterized by the following principles:

1. **Redundancy**: Since we operate at the frontier of cryptographic research rather than in the domain of "settled" cryptography, we plan for yet-unknown protocol-level vulnerabilities by providing alternative implementations that rely on different cryptographic assumptions and tools.

2. **Reusability**: Cryptography code is typically written once, audited, and then forgotten. We aim for reusability through modular design. For example, our [sigma protocols](./pkg/proofs/sigma/) can be made non-interactive using different [compilers](./pkg/proofs/sigma/compiler/) ([Fiat-Shamir](./pkg/proofs/sigma/compiler/fiatshamir/), [Fischlin](./pkg/proofs/sigma/compiler/fischlin/), [Randomised Fischlin](./pkg/proofs/sigma/compiler/randfischlin/)) or [composed](./pkg/proofs/sigma/compose/) together ([AND](./pkg/proofs/sigma/compose/sigand/), [OR](./pkg/proofs/sigma/compose/sigor/)) with minimal additional code. Similarly, our [CRT](./pkg/base/nt/crt) and [Fast modular arithmetic](./pkg/base/nt/modular/) is implemented independently so that both [Paillier](./pkg/encryption/paillier/) and future applications like RSA can use it. We have also made extensive use of interfaces (see [commitments.go](./pkg/commitments/commitments.go) or [encryption.go](./pkg/encryption/encryption.go)/[kemdem.go](./pkg/encryption/kemdem.go)) to maximally cover future applications.

## Focus

The primary focus of this library is MPC (Multi-Party Computation), specifically threshold signing. We support the following protocols:

- **Threshold Schnorr**: [Lindell22](./pkg/threshold/tsig/tschnorr/lindell22/) ([Reference](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/374))
- **Threshold ECDSA**: [DKLs23](./pkg/threshold/tsig/tecdsa/dkls23/) ([Reference](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/765)) and [Lindell17](./pkg/threshold/tsig/tecdsa/lindell17/) ([Reference](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/552)). We provide three variants of DKLs23: [one](./pkg/threshold/tsig/tecdsa/dkls23/signing/interactive/sign_softspoken/) using OT extensions (compatible with the paper), [one](./pkg/threshold/tsig/tecdsa/dkls23/signing/interactive/sign_bbot/) without OT extensions, and [one](./pkg/threshold/tsig/tecdsa/dkls23/signing/interactive/sign/) that generates base OT during signing.
- **Threshold BLS**: [Boldyreva02](./pkg/threshold/tsig/tbls/boldyreva02/) ([Reference](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36288-6_3))

The design of threshold signing protocols are stateless. Orchestrating them is not in scope of this library; this includes implementation of the networking layer as well. For example, to establish the broadcast channel one typically has to do [Echo-Broadcast](./pkg/network/echo/) yet this is implemented as a separate package.

## Security Notice

This library is not designed to be fully side-channel resistant. We build higher-level protocols on top of a side-channel resistant foundation of elliptic curve (usually generated by fiat-cryptography, for example see [K256](./pkg/base/curves/k256/impl/)) and [big integer operations](./pkg/base/nt/numct/) (wraps [saferith](https://github.com/cronokirby/saferith) and [borinssl](./pkg/base/cgo/boring/)).

**Important**: This library is intended for use by experienced cryptographers and developers who understand the security implications of the protocols involved. If you are not familiar with the underlying cryptographic primitives, please consult with a cryptography expert before using this library in production.
