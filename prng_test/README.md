# PRNG tester

This is using [TestU01] <http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/testu01/tu01.html> to test pseudo random number generator. The prebuilt native library only runs in amd64 (we run it in linux pipeline). If you want to run on other architecture, you need to build the library yourself https://github.com/umontreal-simul/TestU01-2009
