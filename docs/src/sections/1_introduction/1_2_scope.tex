\subsection{Scope}\label{sec:scope}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

The present specification is limited scope to cryptographic protocols and their required primitives only. Therefore, we purposely leave out the details of networking aspects of these multi-party protocols, e.g., how to establish and maintain the communication channels among participants, as well as application-related implementation choices, e.g., using a ledger and/or a coordinator to synchronize a participant's status across multiple devices. 

The specification is organized as follows. We kick off with the preliminaries, describing the primitives required by our main protocols in \autoref{sec:preliminaries}. We introduce the single-party signing schemes in \autoref{sec:signatures}, generalizing them to multiple parties in \autoref{sec:threshold_signatures} and building up the complete protocols for threshold ECDSA in \autoref{sec:tecdsa}, for threshold Schnorr (closely related to EdDSA) in \autoref{sec:tschnorr} and for threshold BLS in \autoref{sec:tbls}.
