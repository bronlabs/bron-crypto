    abstract = {We describe PeerReview, a system that provides accountability in distributed systems. PeerReview ensures that Byzantine faults whose effects are observed by a correct node are eventually detected and irrefutably linked to a faulty node. At the same time, PeerReview ensures that a correct node can always defend itself against false accusations. These guarantees are particularly important for systems that span multiple administrative domains, which may not trust each other.PeerReview works by maintaining a secure record of the messages sent and received by each node. The record isused to automatically detect when a node's behavior deviates from that of a given reference implementation, thus exposing faulty nodes. PeerReview is widely applicable: it only requires that a correct node's actions are deterministic, that nodes can sign messages, and that each node is periodically checked by a correct node. We demonstrate that PeerReview is practical by applying it to three different types of distributed systems: a network filesystem, a peer-to-peer system, and an overlay multicast system.},

In stead, the members choose the secret key and distributes it verifiably among themselves. Subsequently, this key can be used for authentication as well as secret communication.},

FROST signatures can be issued after a threshold number of entities cooperate to issue a signature, allowing for improved distribution of trust and redundancy with respect to a secret key. Further, this draft specifies signatures that are compatible with {[}RFC6979{]}. However, unlike {[}RFC6979{]}, the protocol for producing signatures in this draft is not deterministic, so as to ensure protection against a key-recovery attack that is possible when even only one signer participant is malicious.},

These are schemes having a single-round signing protocol, possibly with one prior round of message-independent pre-processing. We fit FROST1 and BLS, which are leading practical schemes, into our hierarchy, in particular showing they meet stronger security definitions than they have been shown to meet so far. We also fit in our hierarchy a more efficient version FROST2 of FROST1 that we give. These definitions and results, for simplicity, all assume trusted key generation. Finally, we prove the security of FROST2 with key generation performed by an efficient distributed key generation protocol.},
