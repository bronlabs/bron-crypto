# `cipher` custom cipher interface
This package expands `cipher.Block` with functions to clone and to set the cipher's key. We implement the interface in a fork of golang's `crypto/aes` package, modified to expose the `expandKeyAsm` internal function via a `SetKey` function. 

In `tmmohash` package the keys change at each iteration. `crypto/aes` forces an allocation of a struct for each key refresh, incurring in a high overhead for use-cases such as that of `tmmohash`. By maintaining the same initialized memory throughout multiple key expansions, this `cipher.KeyedBlock` makes the process of `expansion -> encrypt` **seven times faster** than by using classical golang.
