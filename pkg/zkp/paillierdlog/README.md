# Zero-Knowledge proof of a Paillier encryption of a discrete log (PDL)
Zero-knowledge proof that a value encrypted in a given Paillier ciphertext is
the discrete log of a given Elliptic curve point. This doesn’t need to be a proof of
knowledge. See section 3.1 of [Fast Secure Two-Party ECDSA Signing][Lin17] for details.
