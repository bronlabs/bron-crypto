# Algebrautils

Utilities for working with algebraic structures such as monoids, groups, rings, and fields.

## Features

- **Random Sampling** - Generate random non-identity elements from finite monoids
- **Folding Operations** - Apply binary operations, addition, or multiplication across elements
- **Scalar Multiplication** - Efficient fixed-window scalar multiplication for monoid elements

Designed to work with the abstract algebra structures defined in `pkg/base/algebra`.
