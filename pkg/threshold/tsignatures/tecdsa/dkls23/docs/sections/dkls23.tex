As our principal threshold ECDSA protocol, we select the 3-round $t$-out-of-$n$ signing protocol of \cite{DKLS23} realizing the standard ECDSA signature scheme (Scheme \ref{alg:ecdsa}) with UC security against $t-1$ static corruptions. The full description can be found in Protocol 3.6 of \cite{DKLS23}. We are largely faithful to the original paper, save for the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We fix a typo in the second consistency check (Step 8 of Protocol 3.6 in \cite{DKLS23}), writing $\pk_j$ instead of $\lambda_j \cdot \party{j}$.
    \item For the $\idealfn{Zero}$ functionality, instead of concatenating the seeds with an index, we salt the shared seeds with the session id. This session id is derived from the \fn{AgreeOnRandom} primitive (\autoref{sec:mpc_agreeonrandom}) per signing session.
    \item $R_i$ is included in the partial signature, for the aggregator to compute the sum and the recovery ID independently while normalizing the signature.
    \item For DKG we resort to GJKR05~\cite{gennaroDKG} instead of their pick based on the DKG of DKLs19~\cite{DKLs19}.
    \item For the discrete log proofs we resort to the randomized Fischlin transformation (Figure 9 of \cite{kondiShelatTransform}, described in Scheme \ref{alg:fischlin}) to achieve non interactivity, replacing the common Fiat-Shamir transform \cite{fiatShamirTransform} that would not be UC secure in this context.
    \item As the paper recommends and separately confirmed by the authors, the OT extension required by the $\idealfn{RVOLE}$ functionality (and instantiated with SoftSpokenOT~\cite{softspokenot} in our case) is made non-interactive with Fiat-Shamir while retaining UC security\footnote{This is achieved, among other reasons, thanks to the existence of fresh randomness in the transcript, tied to the generation of a fresh session ID per run of the protocol.}.
\end{itemize}
