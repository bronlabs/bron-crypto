\paragraph{Library-wide CSPRNG.}\label{sec:nistcsprng}
We select a construction from the NIST SP 800-90A standard~\cite{barker2012ctrdrbg} called \textsf{CTR\_DRBG} (Counter mode Deterministic Random Bit Generator, based on AES in counter mode) to act as the base cryptographically secure random number generator for all our cryptographic operations. We seed this construction with a high-entropy source obtained from the Operating System's randomness API (e.g., \textsf{/dev/random} in Linux\footnote{\url{https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/urandom.4.html}}, \textsf{BCryptGenRandom} in Windows\footnote{\url{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccng/cng-portal}}). As a distinctive feature, the seed is automatically updated after generating a certain number of bits (a.k.a. \textit{reseeding}) by sampling a fresh seed from the high-entropy source. We refer to the NIST SP 800-90A standard~\cite{barker2012ctrdrbg} for details on the construction and its security analysis, as well as the NIST Deterministic Random Bit Generator Validation System (DRBGVS)~\cite{keller2009nist} to validate our implementation.
