# CoGen (Cohort Generation)

This package implements the CoGen protocol, which is a protocol for generating and verifying a group key from a set of public keys which are generated by a set of participants.

```
Primitive:
	Round 1:
		P_i locally generate their group key
		Output group public key. Message type should be “Round1OutbandBroadcast”.
	Round2:
		P_i gets P_js group public keys.
		Sorts all group public keys, hash and sign the output.
		Output signature.
	Round3:
		P_i gets signature_j
		Verifies signature_j is a signature by group key_j of the hash computed in Round2. Abort if fail.
		Return nil.
